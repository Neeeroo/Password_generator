# Password_generator

THIS GENERATOR IS IN SWEDISH
 
This generator was made on my sparetime as a hobby project.
To run this generator you have to type the following in your terminal:
```python .\password_generator.py```

Once you run the program it will ask you how 3 different variables you want in the password;
1. Letters 
2. Symbols
3. Numbers

You can only enter integer numbers for it to be recognized or you'll be stuck on the step.
Once you complete the steps it'll generate a password for you, then ask if you'd like to generate another one.
In this step the only acceptable answer is Y (Yes) or N (No). PS. This step is **_NOT_** case sensitive.

Once you feel done with generating passwords answer "N" on the last question and it will itterate a list
of the passwords you've generated in the session in order of generation.
